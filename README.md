# Matthew Beckerman's Personal Website

## About

I wanted to create a personal website for a couple of reasons:
1: To refresh my developing skills and learn new skill sets
2: To centralize all of my professional/creative social media accounts
3: To go more in-depth about my previous work-experience, education, and about me to potential employers
4: To have fun :)

## Technology Used

I created this website using React and Styled Components.
